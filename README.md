# deep-learning-challenge

My name is Sean Weeks, this is my submission for the Module 21 Challenge.

This repository includes the two Jupyter Notebook and Python codes:

"AlphabetSoupCharity" contains the code that recorded the first five runs that required different adjustments to make the model as accurate as possible, while "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization", the latest version contains two additional runs.

The report on the Nueral Network Model is located in the same directory, saved as a PDF.

-XPert Learning Assistant, used to review and double-check the code as needed.
